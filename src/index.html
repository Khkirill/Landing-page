                    <h1>N95 Respirators</h1>
                    <p><b>The N95 mask</b> is a form of respiratory protective wear worn over the
                        nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of inhaling airborne
                        particles like viruses and other germs. It is a disposable mask made
                        from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly specialised
                        process called melt blowing. During this process, the inner layer of the
                        N95 mask is created which forms the filtration layer capable of
                        filtering out at <b>least 95%</b> of airborne particles when worn correctly.</p>
                    <p class="blog-p__main">
                        During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of
                        intense air pollution, wearing <b>N95 masks</b> has been shown to help
                        reduce the inhalation of compromised air, filtering out nasty
                        pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate existing
                        respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered respiration
                        is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy and people with
                        pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility can particularly benefit
                        from wearing face masks while they are out in public and unable to
                        control the breathing environments that they find themselves in.

                    <h1>N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings</h1>
                    <p>Most <b>N95 respirators</b> are manufactured for use in construction
                        and other industrial type jobs that expose workers to dust and small particles.
                        They are regulated by the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL)
                        in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is part of the 
                        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
                    <p class="blog-p2__main">However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health care setting. 
                        Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory protective devices used and worn by 
                        health care personnel during procedures to protect both the patient and health care personnel 
                        from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. These surgical N95 respirators are 
                        class II devices regulated by the FDA, under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.</p>
